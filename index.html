      <h3>Structure Of A Story</h3>
      <p> If you ask a child, <q>What's the order of a good story?</q> they'll respond with, <q>Oh, that's easy there's a beginning, a middle and an end.</q>
          However if you ask a script writer the same question, they might respond and say there are six part:<blockquote cite=""><p>the setup, catalyst, first turning point, climax,
          final confrontation and resolution.</p>
          </blockquote> </p>

          <p>Every answer will differ from person to person, therefore all a leader needs is a simple structure that works. everyone is natural-born storyteller,
              since we grew up listening to bedtime stories, which helped us to know what's a good structure for a story.</p>

      <p>A useful tip for remembering the basic structure of a story is to use <acronym title="Context Action Result">CAR</p>

        <p><b>Context-</b> This provides all the necessary background for the story to make sense. If done right, it generates interest and excitement in the audience,
                              which then makes them listen to the rest of the story.
        <br><b>Action-</b> This is where you tell the ups and downs that happens to the main character. These help build excitement in the story.
        <br><b>Result-</b> This is the final stage where you not only explain the right lesson intended to be learnt by the audience, but also the reason why you told the story in the first place.</p>
